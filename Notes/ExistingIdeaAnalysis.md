# Introduction

This aims to sort idea groups into "tiers" and indicate how good or not the groups are in a multiplayer setting. This is intended as background for how these ideas might be balanced at a later point.

# Tier List

Unlike conventional tiers, this isn't a simple list of tiers where one is clearly ahead of the other. Instead, ideas are grouped into one of the following categories:

- *Overpowered*: The group is essentially a mandatory pick for any conventional power.
- *Strong*: The group is a strong pick and almost always worth consideration.
- *Weak*: The group is deemed weak and is likely to only be considered after any overpowered or strong ideas have been taken.
- *Useless*: The group is so bereft of any benefit that there are minimal multiplayer situations where this should ever be taken.
- *Naval*: The group is naval focused and essentially mandatory for naval nations but can be ignored otherwise.
- *Colonial* The group is focused on colonising and is essentially mandatory for any nations needing to do so but can be ignored otherwise. Likely to be dropped late game once the map has been colonised.

The ranking is considered solely based on multiplayer utility. It assumes that the game will be such that after the first 100 years, the majority of lands (at least in Europe) will be occupied by players.

The list is then as follows:

- *Overpowered*: Quantity, Economic
- *Strong*: Innovative, Religious, Trade, Offensive, Quality
- *Weak*: Administrative, Defensive, Plutocratic, Aristocratic
- *Useless*: Humanist, Espionage, Diplomatic, Influence
- *Naval*: Maritime, Naval*
- *Colonial*: Expansion, Exploration

# Administrative Groups

One thing that should also be stressed that applies to all groups here, is that administrative points see the least use in a multiplayer scenario, as all that is really done with admin points is coring land (which will get filled with players, and thus the amount of coring is significantly less than in single player) and increasing stability and tech. As such, they can be considered relatively "free" picks in terms of monarch power compared to the other groups.

## Administrative

Ranking: Weak

Conveys very little in the way of actual bonuses. Interest per annum is ok, and the government capacity might be ok but can generaly be compensated for with buildings and trade companies. The mercenary benefits are very minor. Core creation cost whilst normally an incredibly powerful modifier (and is usually the reason for taking this group) loses a lot of benefit. However, if chosen on a nation which already has this modifier (such as the Ottomans or Mughals) or a nation which has AI land to expand into, it can be useful.

It also confers very little in the way of useful policies. The only notable picks are a 20% trade efficiency bonus with trade, and a 10% manpower bonus with Plutocratic (which is only notable as it costs admin points to maintaain rather than military points).


## Economic

Ranking: Overpowered

The group has not only a good degree of bonuses itself but a wide array of good policies.

The 20% development cost reduction is the standout modifier and combined with the policy with Quantity for another 10% (which also gives 10% forcelimit and costs admin to maintain), which would essentially be worth the idea group by itself.

Base ideas also give 10% construction cost, 0.5 interest, 5% land maintenance and 10% production efficiency which gives a nice net profit. The autonomy change is useful for quickly getting lands down to 0% to maximise their benefit. The inflation reduction is also solely housed in this idea group and will in most cases allow it to decay passively to zero, and is a must for any nation with gold income.

Outside the aforementioned policy, other good picks are Trade (10% production and 10% trade efficiency), Naval (10% goods produced and 10% production), offensive (10% artillery combat) and quality (5% discipline).

## Expansion

Ranking: Colonial

Gives 2 colonists, 5% settler chance and 20 settler growth. This is a must have pick to be able to colonise at a reasonable speed. Benefits outside of colonising are small. The merchant is useful as is 20% trade power and the 10% minimum autonomy can have an impact if stacking trade companies. However, for a nation not colonising there are far better administrative groups.

Policies are useful but there are not many that are strong enough to warrant picking it under normal circumstances. It synchronises well with Exploration for another 20 settler growth and -50% aggressiveness (which allows coexistance without risk of native attacks). Outside that is essentially just Maritime (33% naval forcelimit), Trade (10% trade efficiency and 20% trade steering, the latter potentially being very powerful), Aristocratic (-15% construction cost can save a decent amountof money), Plutocratic (10% production efficiency and 10% manpower, but uses admin power), Quality (+1 land leader fire) and Quantity (10% forcelimit, 10 settler growth).

## Humanist

Ranking: Useless

The main issue with this group is the focus on reducing rebellions. A player will likely have a core group of lands and be limited in expansion and rebels are almost always a non-issue, which immediately removes the main selling point of the group. The 30% relations bonus (for early game AI expansion) and 10% idea cost bonuses only really work well if taken early, but Economic is just so critical that this would never be worth it.

The policies of the group are also particularly lackluster. Combining with Quantity gives +1 leader shock but other policies are simply better for the military slot.

## Innovative

Ranking: Strong

Has an array of nice modifiers, many of which are better taken early (particularly the innovativeness gain and technology cost). This is often a candidate in the #3 or #4 slots. The war exhaustion reduction is particularly helpful by itself and it gives a direct military bonus in an extra leader. The advisor cost reduction is significant and if stacked can generate lots of monarch points which lead to more development. Another understated bonus to the technology cost is for a player to rush a critical military tech a year early.

Policy wise it has some useful picks. Best options are Quality (10% infantry combat) Offensive (10% siege, +1 leader siege) and Aristocratic (20% trade effiency).

## Religious

Ranking: Strong

Religious conversion itself is generally not an issue, particularly as players will not grow as much. Options such as trade companies also remove the need to convert. Christians in particular gain enough missionary chance not to need these modifiers. However, the group's main singular benefit is the casus belli. If taken early this gives automatic CBs on neighbours which unlike conquest do not have unjustified demands to eat into diplomatic points that could be spent developing, though this has the caveat that there has to be heretic or heathen nations to use it on. Culture conversion is situationally useful but the power is generally better spent on just directly development pushing.

Outside this though, religious has some exceptionally strong policies, namely Trade (10% goods produced, 1% missionary strength), Quality (5% morale, 10% siege) and Quantity (10% morale, 5% morale recovery). These policies also synergise with other groups already ranked highly on their own.

# Diplomatic Groups

In contrast to administrative points, diplomatic points are far more useful for development, which naturally makes a diplomatic group weaker than it would be if it gained the same benefits as an administrative group.

## Diplomatic

Ranking: Useless

Normally a great group in single player this is very little use in multiplayer. Diplomats are of very little use outside of spy networks on players (which are not particularly great anyway). The diplo relation, diplo rep and improve relations benefits are again basically single player only. The warscore cost reduction is ok but in player wars this might amount to one extra province from a player if pushing a very high warscore peace. The lowered stab impact is also lessened as stability is easy to buy with admin points and a player isn't likely to be taking its usual benefits, such as regular breaking of marriages or truce-breaking.

It also conveys very little in terms of useful policies. Even the candidates which are ok (Innovative for -10% advisor cost, Quantity for 10% forcelimit) are generally outclassed.

## Espionage

Ranking: Useless

Spying is not a particularly strong mechanic against players, at least not until end-game where powerful actions become available. Even then, there are generally attainable without the spy bonuses this gives, but it is of some benefit. The normally excellent extra diplomat and 20% aggressive expansio nreduction are of little use against players. Arguably its only decent uses are 10% advisor costs and 33% privateer efficiency, though the latter is only useful for naval nations.

There are a few useful policies but most are either tied to weak idea groups or would not be favoured. Plutocaratic gives a very strong 33% manpower boost. Aristocratic gives 10% cavalry ability but outside of hordes or Poland this is unlikely to see use. Naval gives +10% engagement width which might equate to an extra heavy, but better naval bonuses exist.

## Exploration

Ranking: Colonial

Mandated for basically any colonial nation (with the exceptions of Iceland and Norway) for the ability to recruit explorers alone. Gives an extra colonist and settler increase. The colonial range is particularly useful for Western Europeans early game but becomes useless afterwards.  The only benefit outside colonial ideas is the 25% naval forcelimit. Tarrifs are useless and envoy travel time isn't going to matter against players, and expel minorities is essentialy useless given that it no longer converts the land being expelled. 

Policy wise it is a good group. It synchronises well with Exploration for another 20 settler growth and -50% aggressiveness (which allows coexistance without risk of native attacks). Aristocratic gives +33% manpower, Defensive gives 10% naval morale, Naval gives 20% engagement width, Offensive gives 50% privateer efficiency and 5% ship durability and Quantity gives 10% manpower and +1 leader maneuver.

## Influence

Ranking: Useless

A group primarily focused around vassals, which are notoriously unreliable. The forcelimit increase can be useful but unless the player is controlling a loyal player vassal it's very unlikely to be of use. A player is likely only ever creating vassals either because of early game expansion (and therefore they'd be integrated), to control lands the player has no intention of defending or to expand if government capacity or admin points became a problem (which is only likely to occur if the player continues to be bordered by AI powers and can blob).

To compound this, it has essentially no useful policies. It has several extra vassal forcelimit modifiers (Economic, Aristocratic, Plutocratic) which can be useful if stacking vassals, but as noted before this isn't a particularly good tactic most of the time.

## Maritime

Ranking: Naval

The bonuses of this group are entirely naval and offer pretty powerful modifiers. For any naval power this group is essentially mandatory.

It should be stated that as of v1.30, one unstated benefit of the group is that it completely negates naval batteries. Normally these would incur 5% naval attrition per month on any adjacent fleet. With the "ships can repair when in coastal sea zones" bonus though, provided the ships are in supply range, this negates the penalty completely. It isn't even a case of taking the damage but repairing it immedaitely, there is simply no damage. This alone makes it mandatory for naval powers as otherwise they will simply be unable to blockade a player for any length of time.

It has many strong policies, though all of these once again have a naval focus so will not be detailed further.

## Trade

Ranking: Strong

Trade will probably increase income as a direct effect of being picked more than any other idea group in the game. Its effect is weaker for nations which do not have access to a strong trade node to collect in (e.g. Central Germany, Austria, Poland).

In terms of income, it directly gives 20% trade power, 10% trade efficiency and 25% trade steering. It also gives an extra 3 merchants, which for non-colonial powers who lack access to colonial nations and trade companies are generally necessary in order to steer control of nodes they own or influence back to their main node. Each merchant also means an extra level 3 centre of trade.

The group is also blessed with great policies. Administrative gives 20% trade efficiency, Economic gives 10% trade and produuction efficiency, Expansion gives 10% trade efficiency and 20% trade steering. Religious gives 10% goods produced and 1% missionary strenght. Quality gives 20% trade efficiency. Offensive gives 10% movement speed and 10% trade efficiency. Quantity gives a staggering 20% goods produced. There are also a few others not mentioned which are potentially useful as well.

# Miltary

Given the focus of multiplayer is player wars, a strong military is vital. Players are likely to always take the maximum amount of military groups they can take (which without house rules would be 50% of the groups, or a maximum of 4 by end-game). Many of the idea groups classified as "weak" below are in the general context of other groups still strong, but are distinctly weaker than other military groups and thus fall out of favour.

In particular, a non-naval power will generally pick Quantity, Quality and Offensive leaving only one other option.

## Aristocratic

Ranking: Weak

A case of an idea group with decent bonuses, but simply not being strong enough in its own right to generally warrant taking.

The 10% military cost reduction both saves mil points and offers the player the opportunity to take a particularly strong tech a year early. The 33% bonus manpower is strong but not as good as quantity. The tradition decay, extra leader and bonus siege are nice. Cavalary bonuses are fairly useless though outside of Poland or a horde. The nobility loyalty equilibrium also might get the player some slight land maintenance reduction or manpower recovery more often. The other bonuses though are fairly useless.

Policy wise there are only a few notable choices. Expansion for 15% construction cost, Innovative for 20% production efficiency and Espionage for cavalary ability (if being stacked) and Exploration for 33% manpower.

## Defensive

Ranking: Weak

A group which has fallen out of favour over time. The main bonus is the 15% morale boost. The army tradition is often useful early and mid-game and may result in better generals than just direct pip bonuses. Extra maneuver is nice but this is the weakest of all general pips, though at high tradition it might mean more points being distributed elsewhere.

Land maintenance, reduced attrition, reinforce speed, fort defence and attrition for enemies are also OK benefits, but their problem is that in most cases other benefits will trump them. Manpower is high enough that attrition for enemies is unlikely to do much (in particular, if they have a full 40/40 stack sieging, then that's 800 casualties per month), particularly as attrition has no effect when battles are ongoing. The land maintenance is replicated by Quantity and other economic groups would save more. The attrition is also better countered by higher manpower bonuses. Reinforce speed can be circumvented altogether with enough cash by consolidating and recruiting new regiments.

It's main problem though is a complete lack of policies. Exploration gives 10% naval morale and Trade gives 25% trade steering, but outside that most benefits are weak.

## Naval

Ranking: Naval

The bonuses of this group are entirely naval and offer pretty powerful modifiers. For any naval power this group is essentially mandatory. There is very little to say otherwise.

Policies are strong but often naval focused, with the exception of Economic for 10% goods produced and 10% production efficiency.

## Offensive

Ranking: Strong

Gives 5% discipline, 20% land forcelimit, 20% siege ability and +1 leader fire/shock, the latter essentialy equates to +1 on all combat rolls. These alone are simple yet strong modifiers. The other direct benefits are lackluster.

Most policies offered are fairly weak with some notable strong exceptions. Economic gives 10% artillery ability. Innovative gives 10% siege ability and +1 leader siege. Trade gives 10% movement speed and 10% trade efficiency.

## Plutocratic

Ranking: Weak

Different than most military groups it gives economic benefits outside of land maintenance. This consists of an extra merchant, 10% goods produced and 25% caravan power. The burghers loyalty is also an understated benefit as it's simpler to keep them above the 60% loyalty threshold to get the development cost reduction. In terms of military bonuses however, it gives 10% morale which is weaker than Defensive, and a fairly minor 2.5% mercenary discipline.

It has some good policiies, though their issue is that they are often paired with other idea groups which are ranked weakly. Administrative gives 10% manpower, Expansion gives 10% production and 10%manpower, Espionage gives 33% manpower.

## Quality

Ranking: Strong

Gives +10% combat ability to all unit types, 5% discipline and 0.5 tradition. It is notable for including naval bonuses, including 5% ship durability and 10% morale, though the naval attrition is useless, particularly if Maritime is chosen. These bonuses themselves are strong, but not overly powerful.

Instead however it gives some very strong policiies. Economic for 5% discipline. Expansion for +1 land fire. Innovative for 10% infantry ability. Religious for 5% morale and 10% siege ability. Trade for 20% trade efficiency.


## Quantity

Ranking: Overpowered

Alone, the group gives 50% manpower, 20% manpower recovery speed and 50% land forcelimit. Armies are also cheaper with 10% regiment cost and 5% land maintenance. Land attrition reduction and supply limit are useful but not great. Garrison size is practically useless though.

These are strong enough bonuses on their own but the policies it provides are also incredibly strong, particularly Economic (10% forcelimit, 10% dev cost), Religious (10% morale) and Trade (20% goods produced).
