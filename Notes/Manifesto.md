# Introduction

As of the v1.30 patch, the EU4 multiplayer metagame has become increasingly centralised. Though this has always been the case, the particular game lends itself to a very clear metagame. This means in a typical game, the majority of players seeking to optimise their nation will pick broadly the same idea groups time and again. Even when there is variation, it is between a few specific groups, with many groups having only niche utility at best.

Many mods exist out there to resolve these issues, but many also make other sweeping changes to the game. In contrast, this mod aims to perform a rebalance without losing the core feeling of playing a standard EU4 game. It delivers this by altering the bonuses conveyed by idea groups, national ideas, policies, religions, government reforms, estate bonuses and buildings.

Core mechanic tweaks will only be made if they are responsible for a glaring inbalance in the game and should be limited in scope and will likely not be done in early versions of the mod.

The mod makes no attempt to ensure any balance regarding single player. Decisons are made with a complete focus on multiplayer.

# Existing Metagame

Due to a mix of mercenary changes and a large number of available development modifiers, the existing game is metagame is very centralised. A player wishing to stack development and manpower bonuses who then focuses on developing primarily with military power can quickly create an insanely large manpower pool. In contrast, a player not opting for this strategy will quickly find that even if their troops are of superior quality, they will simply run out of men and be forced to use the reworked mercenaries, which are expensive and awkward to use in comparison to normal troops.

Development cost can be acquired very simply by most nations early in the game, as follows:

* 20% from Economic
* 10% from the Economic-Quantity policy
* 5% from Renaissance
* 10% from the state edict
* 10% from prosperity
* 10% from the Burghers Estate

That's already a 65% discount with no other considerations. As modifies are additive and development cost has a base of 50, this translates to each 2% discount saving 1 mana per development click. This means that rounded conservatively, the modifies above already save 32 points per click. Once the midgame hits, this can then be improved with universities for another 20%.

Situationally speaking, this can be improved even more by:

* Many religions which are easily accessible give 10% (Orthodox, Muslim, Shinto, Anglican) or 5% (Protestant, Catholic) bonuses
* Members of the HRE provided the first reform has been passed get another 5%
* Many nations in the game have national ideas for another 10%
* Provinces which are either cloth or cotton give another 10%
* Capital discount can give up to 50% discount, and moving it costs admin points which are of little use otherwise
* Tier 3 centres of trade give 10% discount to all provinces in the state

Development costs also only really start scaling exponentially past 20 developement, so the cheapest and most effective way to play is to amass a good amount of 20 development provinces, which are ideally 1/9/10 (admin/dip/mil). The particular focus is always to ignore tax as much as possible (even exploiting it) as for economic purposes production scales far better than tax. Tax efficiency is the only modifier which effects tax, whilst production gives both production and trade income, meaning it scales based on production efficiency, trade efficiency and goods produced. Any residial base tax just serves to either deprive the player of production income or increase development cost.

Manpower can also be stacked fairly easily and these can be done multiplicatively. Buildings in the province will immediately double manpower. Using the edict will give another 25% (which in real terms is a 12.5% increase assuming the buildings have been constructed). Soldiers houses add extra manpower and give a large effect in many provinces which would have otherwise terrible trade goods. This is then increased by 50% for quantity.

The other optimal strategy regarding manpower lies with estates. The nobility privelege means that for each 1% of land they control, the player gains +1% manpower in exchange for -0.5% base tax. As mentioned, tax is to be deliberately avoided so this is simply not a penalty. This can be maximised from the mid-game on by first growing to 100% crown-land, which is fairly straightforward particularly since seizing can be done every 10 years for 5% and each development click gives 0.2%. Once at this point, take any of the nobility priveleges which reduce crown land to give them a share. After that point, any general selling of crown land retains existing ratios, meaning that estate will get all of the land sold. It's reasonable to assume a player can get at least another 50% manpower boost out of this. Furthermore, the clergy and burgher estates have no similar benefits so there is little reason not to give them 0% crown land.

Other manpower boosts exist, but these are more situational. Notably many nations will gain this in their national ideas and monarchies gain access to another 15% boost, but let's discount those for now and actually do some number crunching.

Suppose a player has a typically developed 1/9/10 province. Each military development in an accepted culture core gives 250 manpower, meaning the province has a base of 2500 manpower. With the manpower buildings this doubles to 5000 manpower. With quantity and a supposed 50% from the nobility estate privelege, this doubles again to 10000 manpower. To put the relative size of a nation into account, the game defines the "France" region as 62 provinces, so a nation of that size can easily obtain 620k manpower. That isn't even counting soldiers houses, which with the above modifiers effectively grant another 12000 manpower per province where they benefit from their trade good. This depends on geography, but to continue the earlier analysis, the "France" region contains 13 provinces with such trade goods, or another 156k manpower to add onto the total.
