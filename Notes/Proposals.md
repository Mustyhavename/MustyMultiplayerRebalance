# Rough Idea Wishlist

## Idea Changes

- Nerf manpower and forcelimit bonuses, particularly from Quantity.
	- Change Quantity bonuses from 50% to 30%
	- Change Aristocratic from 33% to 20%
	- Change Offensive from 20% to 10%

- Nerf the dev cost reduction from Economic from 20% to 10%
	- Might replace this with a second policy which gives 10% somewhere else, with at least one of the two policies dependent on Economic (maybe something like Economic/Plutocratic).
- Buff Aristocratic to make it more cavalry focused
	- Increase the cav cost reduction
	- Extra cav combat ratio
	- Extra flanking range
	- This can likely replace the autonomy, aboslutism and merc manpower bonuses
	- (also slightly tempted to add cavalry ability, might even move it out of quality)
- Buff Plutocratic to make it more merc focused
	- Change the initial merc bonus to a 5% (or even 10% if the merc manpower was removed) merc discipline.
	- Replace manpower recovery speed with some other merc bonus
	- Buff the goods produced to 20% (on the basis that a single policy does this and this should be better)
	- Potentially also group the merchant and caravan power into one and give them some other bonus (advisor cost? tech cost? innovativeness?)
- Buff Defensive
	- Increase the maneuver bonus from +1 to +2
	- Increase the morale from +15% to +20%
	- Increase the fort maintenance from -10% to -20%
	- Increase reinforce speed from 33% to 50%
	- Move the attrition for enemies bonus to replace the land maintenance modifier
	- Change the bonus for all ideas to a combination of land/shock damage received
		- My gut here is for 7.5% as a compromise between 5% (which seems too weak when compared to 5% discipline elsewhere) and 10% (which seems too strong).
		- Might choose 5% but give defensive some policies which can increase it further
- Tweak Offensive
	- Nerf the 20% forcelimit to 10% (as noted earlier)
	- Replace one of the useless ideas (recruitment time probably) with 10% movement speed (to give the group something a bit unique)
	- I'm also considering some kind of fire/shock damage increase but I think that's too strong, though it might be a good candidate in some policies
- Tweak Quality
	- Replace the useless 25% naval attrition with a large drill gain modifier (like +100%)
	- Might replace the 10% cav ability with something else but don't know what - I know some modifiers in the game exist to reduce drill loss so that might be a good candidate
- Buff administrative
	- Merc bonuses shoudl be higher
		- 25% manpower to 50%
		- 10% cost to 20%
		- Perhaps replace the merc maintenance with merc discipline
- Buff Expansion to give it something which isn't just colonial
	- Honestly I have no idea what I would put here though that makes sense.
	- Would be good to make it want to stay relevant after colonising is done
- Buff Humanist
	- No idea what I'd do here but the group is completely rubbish and needs something
- Buff Diplomatic
	- No idea what I'd do here but the group is completely rubbish and needs something
- Buff Espionage
	- Buff the privateer efficiency from 33% to 50%
	- Buff the spy detection from 33% to 50%
	- Is it possible to add in "hostile movement speed" as a modifier? If not then maybe just replace the fairly useless corruption boost with something like attrition for enemies. Trying to thin of something that gives a military bonus of some kind where you can justify it being the owrk of spies disrupting invading forces.
	- I don't know if it's possible or not but I'd love to make it so this unlocks the spy actions early, particularly infiltrate administration as that doesn't normally happen till tech 30 which is riduculously late. Being able to see your enemy movements alone would be a great military reason for picking it and unlike back in earlier versions of the game the idea group does do other things now.
- Buff Influence
	- No idea what I'd do here but the group is completely rubbish and needs something
	- The problem is I'd like to give it something that gave bonuses to vassals in the same way marches do but I don't think that's technically possible. It does feel like the purpose of this group should stay vassal orientated but that in itself makes it weak.
- Buff Exploration
	- Give it back the second colonist it used to have (probably over the useless expel minorities)
	- Buff the +10 settlers to +20
	- Basically, I want it to be viable for a coloniser to take exploration without taking expansion again, but still make expansion give you a good boost. Nations like France should really be good candidates for taking explo.
	- Buff the naval forcelimit from 25% to 33%
	- Buff or replace the tariff bonus
		- I'm pretty sure tarrifs are almost useles from what I can remember, need to do some digging on how it actually works)
	- The stuff like the forcelimit, tarrifs and policies should give nations a reason to want to keep this once they've colonised stuff
	
## Policy Changes

Needs more thought. Want to give a bunch of the groups which have completely useless ideas something good. 

- Move / nerf some of the stronger Economic, Trade and Quantity policies. In particular:
	- The dev cost reduction from Economic/Quantity should be elsewhere (my gut is to move it to Admin/Quantity).
	- The goods produced from Trade/Quantity
- Defensive is in dire need of good policies
- Tempted to nerf the goods produced ones across the board and half them as its just such a powerful modifier

## Building Changes

- Nerf Soldier's households from 1500 manpower to 1000
- Nerf the manpower buildings from 50/100% to 30/60%
- Buff Ramparts from +1 attrition to +2 and +15 defensiveness to +30 (or maybe higher)
	- Ramparts are pretty much useless right now outside of being put on gold mines which are typically in hills/mountains anyway, and even then a soldiers household without the bonus is probably better
- Buff Temples / Cathedrals to make tax a bit more viable (I'd consider buffing tax efficiency stuff across the board as well because of how useless tax is currently)
	- They're currently 40/60 compared to the production buildings which are 50/100. I think they should at least be the same. Tempted to also give temples a 1.5% missionary chance bonus considering Cathedrals get 3%.

## National Idea Changes

- Nerf Britain's naval ideas and buff Spain
- Replace the +1 artillery bonus Spain has with something more balanced
- Buff Austrian ideas (their diplomatic nature and irrelevance of the HRE in multiplayer make them pretty rubbish at the moment)

## Religion Changes

- Nerf Orthodox
	- Reduce the manpower bonus from 33% to 20%
	- Either reduce the -10% dev cost icon to -5% or replace it with something else
- Muslim tweaks
	- Add in a custom decision so that Muslim nations can change their school
		- Ideally once only per monarch lifetime
		- Either make it cost points, cost stab or give some negative modifier for a bit
		- Idea is to make it so you can actually change to a different school rather than be stuck with whichever arbitrary one you start with
	- Replace the -5% admin cost school with -5% all tech cost (who in their right mind would pick it right now)
		- I'd be tempted to make it higher but considering you can pay 50 admin to get the buff temporarily that feels OP
	- Buff / replace the -10% AE modifier (not sure what with)
	- Maybe change the cav ratio from Sunni?
		- Not sure what, the aristocratic buffs might make cav builds more viable though and this might be useful, but equally if you're running a cav build you'd go Shia for the 10% shock)
- Buff Hussite
	- Increase the shock damage received from -5% to -10%
	- Replace the +2% missionary strength with something else (this doesn't even make sense considering the Hussites failed)
- Buff Reformed
	- I think right now it's just inferior to Protestant, as protestant gets half the morale bonus but uses 1/3 of its slots.
	- Be tempted to increase the morale from 10% to 15%
	- Possibly give them a better innate bonus than just heretic tolerance?
- Buff Catholic
	- I'm not sure how I'd do this but I stil think it's weak comapred to Protestant
	- Don't know if it's possible to mod Crusades to be usable on heretics
	- Change the innate bonuses somewhat? Not sure what to though, but +1 true faith tolerance and -1 heretic tolernace is pretty useless
	- Possibly buff some of the Curia actions?
		- +15% tax to +30% (probably still useless though)
		- +15% manpower recovery to +30%

## Estate Changes

- Nerf or rework the nobility bonus that gives manpower for tax based on land share
	- Possibly just half the manpower gain
	- Possibly make the bonus completely flat
	
## Government Reform Changes

- All nations should get estates.
	- I believe this is currently restricted to those that use factions, namely Pirate Republics, Merchant Republics and Revolutionary governments.
	- In exchange, factions may need to be nerfed slightly.
	- Pirate republics change from +75% governing cost to -50% governing capacity (as Prussia)
		- Possibly also give pirate republics some other penalty, thinking an AE increase to simulate that other nations really wouldn't want a pirate expanding
	- Merchant republics to gain -25% governing capacity (less than the others as they naturally get a +25% increase for any land in a state)
	- Give republics some side effect to compensate? Probably not, just nerf their factions and maybe also their revolutionary target buff.
- Needs some more thought out there - but there's a lot of reforms which are completely useles but sit alongside really good ideas and so the choice is a literal no brainer. For example as a monarchy, at tier 2 you can get 15% manpower or 10% tax and -10% nobility influence - why would anyone pick the latter?

## Other Items

- Would love to alter the way professionalism works a bit	
	- Slacken is stupid and should instead give a large manpower recovery increase in exchange for a decay in professionalism rather than a flat cost. 
		- Another option would to be to give the thing a cooldown (e.g. only do it once every 5 / 10 years)
		- Not sure how moddable this is. I'd expect though that I can nerf what it does and replace it with some decisions.
	- Having to take a hit of 5% each time you recruit a merc with immediate effect is dumb, but not sure how moddable this is
		- Ideally you'd lose professionalism based on the percentage of your army that is mercs - so if you hired mercs very briefly you don't see much effect but if you hire a lot of them for a while you start to see your professionalism drop
	- The standardised uniform decisions need a buff, not sure how though.
