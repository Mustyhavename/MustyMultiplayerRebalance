# Increased attrition cap from 5% to 10% (like to increase it more but needs real testing first). Manpower modifier kept unchanged.
# The main effect this has is marching large armies to siege provinces with low supply limits (e.g. mountains), as they'll end up
# taking a lot of attrition damage for that alone. This may well kill the AI, but who cares, this is a multiplayer mod.

# Make scorching now give attrition.
# Note that adding a supply limit reduction would be nice. However, percentages are additive, and technology gives a huge percentages
# bonus over time, so a 50% supply limit modifier only affects the base cost of a province. 
# TODO: As this is more powerful, cost should likely be increased as 5 mil is pretty cheap for this, especially if you stick this on
# a mountain fort with ramparts.
