# Mercenary Professionalism Decay
######################################

# I don't know if there's a better way of doing this, but what this is trying to do is assign a maintenance cost of 1% professionalism
# to each merc company hired. Ideally you'd just have a modifier which worked this out and did some simple maths but I don't think
# Paradox's scripts can do this. Instead, just create several tiers for numbers a player might realistically obtain.
#
# The "potential" flags are there so a player will only see his current modifier and the two adjacent ones, but really don't matter.
