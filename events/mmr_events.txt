# Event triggered by the player decision to change Muslim religious schools.

# TODO: The option to change to your existing school will still show up, which is a bit crap.
# Unfortunately, "NOT = { school = X }" doesn't work.

# TODO: There is no cooldown on this event. I'd like to tie it into the current ruler lifetime but this
# needs looking up.
